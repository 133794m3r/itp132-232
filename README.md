# ITP 132-232 Get out of Class Project

This repo only holds things that are based on the VCCS requirements for ITP132 and 232. AKA C++1 and C++2. I am putting it on github as public b/c I don't care for the code to be out there.

The code in there isn't the world's best but it is what's required. The items contained herein are not meant to be examplars of the language but only the minimal effort to prove that I can do X. I am planning on being done with both classes worth of learning within 2 weeks. I still prefer C but you will see them looking like how I imagine a C++ programmer would do it, not the way that a C programmer would write the code.


## ITP132
This folder includes basic bits of C++. Function overloading, templates, all 3 pass bys for arguments. Vectors, Iterators, 2d arrays. Standard IO streams, files. ETC. All code is minimal and is of the effort that I'd imagine that students are producing for those parts.

## ITP232
This folder will include the 232 items. Recursion, Inheritence, Private, Public, Static methods. Objects, "friend" functions. Linked Lists, Virtual functions. Binary search tree. 

It'll also include operators being overloaded for a super simple object that's templated to get that requirement.

Finally for recursion and other things it'll do basic RSA encryption(only single characters I'm not including bignum or similar libraries). It'll include the egcd, modular multiplicative inverses etc.


Final project will be some super simple OOP thing that I'm not sure of yet.

## Algorithsm
This folder will include the algorithms things. Huffman trees, hashtables whatever else is required later on to get out of this thing if need be. It'll be in here.
